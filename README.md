# guarded_go_router

This package aims to provide a guard mechanism to a project using `go_router` and `riverpod`. 
Main usage is to enhance the state based declarative routing with certain subtrees being protected by some logic.

## GoGuard

A simple abstract class that the specific guards extend and has to override its `passes(): bool` function.

## GuardedGoRouter

A `GoRouter` proxy. This has a `routes: List<RouteBase>` just like the `GoRouter`.
It accepts not only the standard routes (`GoRoute` and `ShellRoute`) but also some custom route types defined by this package:
- `GuardAwareGoRoute` (extends `GoRoute`)
  - there is a simple `goRoute` function which returns a `GuardAwareGoRoute`, to make it easy to switch from `GoRoute` to `goRoute`
- `GuardShell<T>` and `DiscardShell<T>` (extends `ShellRoute`)

## GoNotifier

A helper class to supply to the `GoRouter`'s `refreshListenable`. 
Providers (only always alive ones) can be given to it, whom notifications are triggering the reevaluation of the current route.

## Concepts

- A certain subtree can be "protected" by a guard. (only allow `/dashboard` when `AuthGuard` passes)
  - can be defined via `GuardShell<T>([...routes])`

- All guards must have one assigned route which is the shield route. A "shield" is where the guard can be resolved. (eg: solving the requirement of `AuthGuard` can be done on the `/login` path)
  - can be defined via the `GuardAwareGoRoute`'s `shieldOf: Type` parameter
  - if missing then `ShieldRouteMissingException` is thrown, 
  - if multiple shield path are defined for a guard then `MultipleShieldRouteException` is thrown.

- A certain subtree can be "discarded" by a guard. Meaning that some paths are irrelevant once a guard is passing. (eg `/get-started` or `/signed-out` does not make sense when `AuthGuard` passes)
  - can be defined via
    - the `GuardAwareGoRoute`'s `discardedBy: List<Type>` parameter
    - or the `DiscardShell<T>([...routes])` shell route
  - In case of such discarding guard is defined for a subtree, then a "followUp" route has to be defined for said guard using the `followUp: Type` parameter. (otherwise `FollowUpRouteMissingException` is thrown)
    - the followUp route is used when
      - the current route is discarded by all it's parent guards. (in other words all the guards which are defined to be discarding the current route are passing)
  - In case there is a `followUp` route defined for a guard, but no `discardedBy` or `DiscardShell`, then `MissingDiscardingRouteForFollowUpException` is thrown.

## Mechanism

The `routes` given to the `GuardedGoRouter` are analyzed and based on what is their current context, each route's `redirect` is set to a function (the explicitly defined route level `redirect` has higher precedence) which implements above described logic.
The `buildRouter` required parameter is a function which has to return the actual `GoRouter` and in its params there are the `routes`. These routes are the post processed routes that were given to the `GuardedGoRouter`. (with the `redirect` appending logic, and with pruning the `GuardShell` and `DiscardShell` routes)

When the user tries to access a path that is protected by some guards, then all guards must pass in order to end up on that path. If there is a guard which is not passing, then a redirect happens to first guard's shield route, with also appending the current path as `continue` query parameter. (eg: user wants to go to `/profile/settings` but the `AuthGuard` throws them back to `/login?continue=/profile/settings`)
This `continue` saving logic can be disabled if not desired using:
- `GuardShell([...routes], savesLocation: false)` (defining on the guard)
- `GuardAwareGoRoute(ignoreAsContinueLocation: false)` (defining on the route)
- Invoking the navigation logic inside `guardedGoRouter.neglectContinue(() { ... })`

NOTE: `continue` is only appended as query param, if the path in question is not a shield path of some route.

##Â Caveat

Consider the following two scenarios:

1. When the user tries to navigate to `/dashboard/:id` but it is protected by `AuthGuard`. Then the system redirects the user to `/login?continue=/dashboard/:id` which is desired in this case (user should get back to where they initially wanted to go once they log in successfully)
2. When the user is at the `/dashboard/:id` and clicks the logout button the redirecting should be triggered (via the `GoNotifier`) and recognize that the current route is guarded, so it has to redirect the user to `/login` although in this case appending the `continue` parameter is undesired, since the user simply wanted to log out.

The redirect mechanism of `go_router` doesn't really know anything about "prior" locations or the "direction" of the user (going from outside -> inside, or inside -> outside)

Because of this in some cases the url has to be cleared manually to discard this `continue` behavior.
